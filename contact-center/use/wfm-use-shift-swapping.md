# Use shift swapping

As a customer service representative, shift swapping can be useful for managing your work-life balance. It allows you to exchange shifts with other representatives, giving you the flexibility to attend to personal commitments without affecting your work responsibilities. Shift swapping can help you ensure that your shifts are covered while also supporting your peers.

## Create a shift swap request

1. In the site map of Copilot Service workspace, select **Request Management** under **Workforce Management**. The **All Active Requests** page appears.
1. Select **New**, and then select **Shift Swap** from the dropdown menu. The **New WEM Request** page appears.
1. On the **Select shift** card, enter the details as follows:
      - **Date**: Select the date for the shift you want to swap.
      - **Shift Plan**: Select the name of the plan you want to use for the swap.
      - **Full shift day**: If you want the entire shift to be included in the swap, set **Full shift day** to **Yes**.
      - **Booking**: For a shift swap that doesn't include the entire shift, select the activity to swap. The form populates the **Start Time** and **End Time** for the booking, and calculates the **Hours**.
      - **Note**: Type a note if desired.
1. On the **Select shift to swap** card, enter your **Availability date** and **Preferred time range** so that others know when you're available to swap a shift.
1. If you want the system to notify all representatives who meet your availability criteria, toggle on **Public Post**. If the setting is off, the system lists other representatives' available bookings that can be swapped, and then you can select the shift you want to use and complete the swap.
