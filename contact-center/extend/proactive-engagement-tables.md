# Use proactive engagement tables for reporting (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]


Proactive engagement allows for customer outreach based on configured engagement scenarios and customer data insights.

The `msdyn_proactive_delivery` and `msdyn_proactive_delivery_attribute` tables store the information related to proactive engagement deliveries and associated attributes, providing comprehensive data for reporting and analytics on proactive engagement activities. Organizations can use this data to:

- Track delivery success rates and performance metrics
- Analyze customer engagement patterns and outcomes
- Monitor queue performance and agent productivity
