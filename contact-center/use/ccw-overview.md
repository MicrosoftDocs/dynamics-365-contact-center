# Use Contact Center workspace

The Contact Center workspace application is an agent-facing app in Dynamics 365 Contact Center that provides a powerful agent desktop with Copilot capabilities and collaboration tools across channels like live chat, SMS, voice, Microsoft Teams, and social channels. Contact Center workspace connects to your organization's customer relationship manager (CRM) solution to provide contextual knowledge and customer data to assist agents in resolving customer queries. As an agent, you can have simultaneous customer sessions within the app without losing the context of each session. You can also use Copilot within Contact Center workspace to ask questions pertaining to a case, removing the need to manually search across multiple knowledge sources.

## Prerequisites

You must have the Omnichannel Agent role.

## Access the app

The app is automatically installed in all the Dynamics 365 Contact Center organizations. You can sign in to Dynamics 365, and on the apps page, select Contact Center workspace.

## Contact Center workspace sessions and tabs

Contact Center workspace allows agents to work on multiple sessions at a time in a single app while keeping the work organized.
- Agents can work on up to nine sessions and within a session, they can open up to 10 tabs.
-  A new session starts when an agent opens a case from the **Home** session or accepts an incoming conversation.
-  If the agent opens the customer record from a session, a new tab opens in the same session. 
- Agents can select the hamburger icon to access the site map. 
- When an agent opens a page from the site map, the page loads in the current focused session.

### Navigate sessions and tabs

 The following table gives an overview of the multisession navigation:

| Action | Result |
| ------------ |------------- |
| Open a record from the Home session | Record opens in a new session. |
| Open a record from the Global search | Record opens in a new session. |
| Open a record from the retrieved search records | Record opens in a focused session. |
| Open a record using the Quick Create notification | Record opens in a new session |
| Create a new record | Record opens in a new session |
| Open a record from the timeline | Record opens in a new tab in the focused session |
| Open a record from a form lookup | Record opens in a new tab in the focused session |
