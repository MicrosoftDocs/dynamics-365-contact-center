# Proactive Outbound dashboard

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-cc-only](../includes/cc-feature-availability-cc-only.md)]

The Proactive Outbound dashboard in Omnichannel historical analytics tracks conversation metrics and monitors ongoing conversations, through conversation direction (incoming or outgoing) and conversation type. The dashboard provides organizations with detailed insights into outbound customer engagements initiated through proactive outreach. The dashboard is designed to help teams monitor, analyze, and optimize outbound conversation strategies, ensuring higher delivery rates and improved customer experiences. The dashboard shows delivery status, result, and dial mode, enabling quick identification of trends and bottlenecks. Delivery metrics are segmented by proactive engagement configuration, queue, and date, allowing for granular analysis and targeted improvements.

## Interactive charts

 Users can apply out-of-box filters, such as duration, channel, queue, proactive engagement configuration, and time zone, to refine data for targeted analysis. 
 
 Visualizations provide clear insights: a bar chart displays total deliveries by status (completed, expired, and others), a donut chart shows processed deliveries by result (for example, Live Answer, Answering Machine, Expired), and a pie chart breaks down processed deliveries by dial mode, including new predictive dialing. 
 
 Additionally, delivery metrics tables offer detailed views by engagement configuration, queue, and date, enabling teams to track performance, manage workloads, and analyze trends effectively.

## Panel filters

The dashboard is prefiltered by the default panel filters **Conversation type** and **Conversation direction** to show outbound  interactions only. Additionally, you can check the default panel filters applied under **Dial mode**, **Delivery Status**, **Delivery Result**. You don't need any permissions to view panel filters.
