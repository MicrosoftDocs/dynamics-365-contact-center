# Use break distribution to assign breaks for service representatives

If you have a large volume of customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) that you want to schedule activities for, you can use the auto scheduler on the schedule board to quickly create the shift plan.

## Use break distribution

1. In the site map of Copilot Service workspace, select **Shift planning** in **Workforce Management**. The **My Shift Plans** page appears.
1. Select the shift plan you want to use to book the representatives, and then select **Schedule people** on the task bar. The shift scheduler board appears.
2. Select the **Schedule** dropdown menu, and then select **Break Distribution**. The **Break Distribution** pane appears.
1. For **Duration**, select the start and end dates for the break.
1. Select the check box next to any of the break types you want to set for your representatives, and then enter the corresponding times:
     - **Minimum time from shift start**: Soonest time from when the shift begins for a representative to go on a break.
     - **Maximum time from shift start**: Latest break time after the shift starts.
     - **Minimum time before next break**: The minimum amount of time you want the representative to have in between breaks.
1. Select **Schedule**. The schedule board updates and displays the breaks for the agents in the activity itinerary.
1. Select **Publish**. The system sends a booking notification to the representatives who are scheduled for breaks.
