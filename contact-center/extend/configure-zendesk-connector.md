# Configure the connector for Zendesk

The Zendesk connector allows organizations to engage with their customers using omnichannel capabilities like voice, video, SMS, live chat, and social messaging while keeping their current investments in third-party CRM solutions. The omnichannel add-in works with third-party CRM solutions through data connectors. These connectors help bring the contacts and accounts data from the Zendesk CRM solution into Dataverse.
