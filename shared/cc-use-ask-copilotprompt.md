If your administrator has configured prompt plugins, you can use targeted keywords to gather quick information about the case that you're working on. For example, you can use the following steps to get the account summary of a case. If Copilot doesn't find any details that match the term, then it falls back to the knowledge source to display the resolution from the configured knowledge articles.

1. Open the case that you need to work on and then enter **Get account summary** in the Copilot **Ask a question** pane. If your administrator has configured authentication, the **Authentication needed** message appears on the Copilot screen.
1. Select **Go to authentication**. The **Sign in or connect** dialog appears.
1. Select **Continue**. The system authenticates, and Copilot summarizes and displays the account details of the customer whose case you opened.
1. Select **Check sources**. The plugin that's used for generating the summary is displayed.
1. You can use the options on the Copilot pane to edit or copy, and provide feedback on the response.
