# Autonomous service agents in Dynamics 365

Autonomous agents are intelligent tools designed to enhance customer service efficiency and effectiveness in Dynamics 365 Contact Center and Dynamics 365 Customer Service. With generative AI, they improve customer intent discovery and real-time knowledge management and support self-service and assisted scenarios.

## Customer Intent Agent

The Customer Intent Agent uses generative AI to autonomously discover intents by analyzing past and current cases and customer conversations. It identifies the most common intents and suggests new ones, helping you understand customer needs better. This agent can also recommend the best knowledge articles to resolve customer issues, improving self-service and assisted service experiences. Learn more in [Use intent agents](../use/use-intent-suggestions.md).

## Case Management Agent

> [!NOTE]
> Case Management Agent is available in Customer Service only.

The Case Management Agent helps automate case lifecyle&mdash;create, update, resolve, and close&mdash;to save time that service representatives would otherwise spend on manually filling case details. Administrators can customize the agent's behavior by configuring rules per the organization's requirements. Learn more in [Use Case Management Agent to create and update cases](/dynamics365/customer-service/use/use-case-creation-agent) and [Use Case Management Agent to follow up and close cases](/dynamics365/customer-service/use/use-case-follow-up-closure). 

## Customer Knowledge Management Agent

Customer Knowledge Management Agent helps extract knowledge from cases and manage customer knowledge in real time. After a case is closed, the Customer Knowledge Management Agent analyzes case details, fills knowledge gaps, and makes sure of compliance. Learn more in [Manage Customer Knowledge Management Agent](/dynamics365/customer-service/administer/admin-km-agent) and [Review knowledge articles created by Customer Knowledge Management Agent](/dynamics365/customer-service/use/admin-km-agent-review).

## Quality Evaluation Agent

Quality Evaluation Agent helps generate autonomous and AI-assisted assessments of customer interactions across cases and conversations using an evaluation framework defined by supervisors. Supervisors can create evaluation criteria and plans and use the evaluations to improve customer interactions. Learn more in [Manage Quality Evaluation Agent](manage-quality-evaluation-agent.md#manage-quality-evaluation-agent).
