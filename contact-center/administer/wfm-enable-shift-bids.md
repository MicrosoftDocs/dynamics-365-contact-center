# Enable shift bids

Enable shift bidding so that your customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) can participate in their shift selections by using a bidding process. 

Key features include:

- Bid for shifts: Service representatives can view available shifts and submit bids directly from the **My Schedule** view or **Request Management**.
- Select preferred shifts: Representatives can place bids based on their preferred working hours, that helps them choose shifts that fit their personal schedules.
- Shift release for bidding: Schedulers can release shift plans for bidding, giving service representatives the opportunity to select the shifts they prefer.
- Bidding management: Schedulers can review and manage shift bidding requests within the shift plan or **Request Management** view to ensure coverage is maintained.

## Prerequisites

1. Install the **Workforce Management for Customer Service** package in the Power Platform admin center app. Once installed, you can create forecast scenarios based on your operational needs.
