# Manage ongoing Quality Evaluation Agent conversations

As a supervisor, you can effectively oversee ongoing Quality Evaluation Agent conversations to maintain smooth operations and boost customer engagement. The **Ongoing QEA conversations** view provides real-time visibility into active interactions along with their associated scores, helping you analyze customer behavior and guide customer service representatives towards improved performance.

## Prerequisites

- You have the Omnichannel Supervisor role. Learn more in [Assign roles and enable users](/dynamics365/customer-service/implement/add-users-assign-roles). 

## Access the Ongoing QEA conversations view

In the site map of Copilot Service workspace, go to **Conversations**, and then select **Ongoing QEA conversations** from the dropdown.

## View real-time scores

To view real-time scores, you can either:

- Select a conversation and then choose the **Real-time Score** option, or
- Select the score link associated with the conversation. 

A side pane appears and displays the real-time evaluation details, including the overall score and sentiment score for each section-level criterion you configured.
