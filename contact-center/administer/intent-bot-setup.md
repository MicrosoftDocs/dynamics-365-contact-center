# Configure intent-based follow-up suggestions for customer intent agents

As an administrator, you'll no longer need to manually create customer intent agent topics that could be deprecated.

Intent assist discovers historical data and maintains an up-to-date intent library, along with the attributes to support intent determination, interview, and fulfillment, leading to much higher deflection.

Intent assist uses the determined intent and interview responses to also improve the quality of generated answers for both customer intent agents and customer service representatives.

## Prerequisites

- **Customer Intent Agent** is enabled on the Customer Intent Agent (preview) page.
- Make sure that you have a system administrator role. (Please provide info on any other roles/licenses that may be required)

## Here's how it works

- An administrator sets up intent, harvests historical data to build intent library, and enables the library for customer intent agents and customer service representatives. The administrator also enables knowledge harvesting and connects to the customer intent agent.
- Customer intent agent detects intent from the customer, asks follow-up questions related to the intent, and provides a solution based on customer provided information from the connected customer intent agent knowledge source.
- If the issue is escalated, it's transferred to customer service representatives and the customer service representatives persists intent and interview questions generated by customer intent agents, goes through unanswered questions with customer, and gets an updated solution.
- Once the issue is closed, a new knowledge article for the undocumented resolved issue is harvested, along with new intent attributes for use in self service.
- The supervisor approves and publishes the article, and it's made available in the knowledge source that the Copilot Studio bot is connected to.
- The application also harvests this conversation to detect any updates, and discovers new intent attributes that can be used in future interviews.
- In the next customer interaction with a customer intent agent, the customer intent agent can self service the customer issue with the newly harvested knowledge and intent, and provide a tailored response without the involvement of any customer service representative.
