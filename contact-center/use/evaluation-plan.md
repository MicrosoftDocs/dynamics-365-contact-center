# Use evaluation plan

**Conversations**: [!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-cc-only](../includes/cc-feature-availability-cc-only.md)]

**Cases**: [!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-cs-only](../includes/cc-feature-availability-cs-only.md)]


Evaluation plans help supervisors perform consistent and objective reviews of cases and conversations. You can define criteria methods, conditions, and evaluation plans to support both manual and AI-driven assessments. This article describes how to create, activate, and manage evaluation plans, and enable bulk evaluations to streamline your review process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Evaluations for conversations and bulk evaluations for cases are preview features. 
> - Preview features arenâ€™t meant for production use and might have restricted functionality. These features are subject to [supplemental terms of use](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189520), and are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

## Prerequisites

- Enable [Quality Evaluation Agent](../administer/manage-quality-evaluation-agent.md#manage-quality-evaluation-agent).
- Assign the required [roles and privileges](../administer/manage-quality-evaluation-agent.md#role-and-privileges).
- Set up [Microsoft Copilot credits](/dynamics365/customer-service/administer/setup-pay-as-you-go?context=/dynamics365/contact-center/context/administer-context).
- Provide consent for potential [data movement across regions](../administer/manage-quality-evaluation-agent.md#data-movement-across-regions).
