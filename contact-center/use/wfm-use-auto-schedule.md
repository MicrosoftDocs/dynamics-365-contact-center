# Use auto schedule to schedule service representatives

## Use auto schedule

1. On the Copilot Service workspace site map, select **Shift planning** in **Workforce Management**. The **My Shift Plans** page appears.
1. Select the shift plan you want to use to book the representatives, and then select **Schedule people** on the task bar. The shift scheduler board appears.
2. Select the **Schedule** dropdown menu, and then select **Auto-Schedule**. The **Auto-Schedule Criteria** pane appears.
1. For **Duration**, select the start and end dates for the activity.
1. Set the filters for **Agent availability**, **Match Skills**, and **Match Queue** as desired.
1. Set the **Availability order** to either **Most Available to Least** or **Least Available to Most**.
