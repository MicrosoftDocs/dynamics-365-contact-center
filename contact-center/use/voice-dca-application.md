# Use desktop companion application with voice channel

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

The desktop companion application serves as a backup and allows you to continue conversations without interruption when the Copilot Service workspace web application faces issues.

## Prerequisites

Either the desktop companion application is installed on your desktop or the browser extension is installed.

## Use the desktop companion application

After you sign in to the Copilot Service workspace and receive a call, you can view the call in the desktop companion application. Perform one of the following actions to launch the application:

- Open the application from the Windows toolbar to manage the call in the application and continue the conversation from the web browser. You can also minimize the application that continues to run in the background.
 
 > [!NOTE]
 > If you can't see the icon, restart your device. If the desktop companion application doesn't appear after restarting, contact your administrator.
 
- Launch the application from the browser extension. 

Launch the application if you face issues such as network latency, web application freezes or reloads. You can also make sure that your headset and wireless devices stay connected using the application.

You can do the following actions:

- View the environment you're signed in to and your sign-in information.
- View ongoing calls. A message appears in the communication panel indicating that the call is handled by the desktop companion application. If this message doesn't appear, the application might not be functioning as expected.
- On an active call, you can use the call controls to mute, unmute, or end the call.
- You can switch between an active call and a call that's on hold.
- Select **Settings** to do the following actions:
   - Select **Language** to specify the language you want to use.
   - In the **Device Settings** section, you can view the available microphone and speaker devices and select the device you want to use. To save your headset and microphone preferences, temporarily select devices that are different from your default options, then switch back to your preferred devices.
   - Select **Test Call** to ensure that the microphone and speaker are working well.
   - View the application's version information in **About this app**.

> We recommend that you use the desktop companion application at a time with one environment only. To switch between environments, close the current environment before moving to another.

## Report issues

If you face issues with the desktop companion application, generate the support files with a right-click on the menu, select **Generate Support Files**, and send them to Microsoft support.
