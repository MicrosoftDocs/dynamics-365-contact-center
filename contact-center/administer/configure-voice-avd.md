# Use Microsoft Azure Virtual Desktop to access voice channel

You can configure the Remote Desktop client in your customer service representatives' (service representative or representative) remote desktops. This enables service representatives to connect to the voice channel using the Virtual Desktop. 

## Prerequisites

- [Connect to Azure Virtual Desktop with the Remote Desktop client for Windows](/previous-versions/remote-desktop-client/connect-windows-cloud-services) to ensure that representatives have Virtual Desktop installed on their remote desktop.
- Make sure that [Insider release](/previous-versions/remote-desktop-client/client-features-windows-msrdc) is enabled for the remote desktop client.
- [Install the multimedia redirection extension](/azure/virtual-desktop/multimedia-redirection) on the service representatives' browsers. Supported browsers are Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.

### Access remote desktop

Make sure representatives perform the following steps to access the voice channel from the remote desktop after it's installed:

1. Restart the remote desktop client and the service representative's device.
1. Ensure that service representatives see **Remote Desktop(Insider)** is displayed on the remote desktop client.
1. Select the **ellipsis** (…) and then select **Subscribe**. 

Representatives see **SessionDesktop** once they're subscribed. They can sign in the Virtual Desktop to use the voice channel.

## Agent experience when local device disconnects from Azure Virtual Desktop

Representatives can communicate with customers on the phone to resolve issues using the voice channel through the Azure Virtual Desktop. The following table describes the scenarios in which the local device disconnects from the virtual desktop instance.

| Service representative is disconnected from the Virtual Desktop.                        | Notifications aren't delivered to service representative.          | The ongoing call remains assigned to the service representative. The customer hears a message that the service representative is disconnected and will rejoin the call shortly, followed by wait music. | Non-voice conversations remain assigned to the service representative. If the representative is in a chat that is converted to a voice or video call, the voice or video call ends. | The secondary representative hears a message that the primary representative is disconnected.                                                   | The call ends for the secondary representative.                                                                                       | Not applicable                                                                                                   |
| Service representative reconnects to the Virtual Desktop instance in less than 30 seconds. | Incoming notifications are displayed to the representative. | Representative is reconnected to the call. The call status, such as hold or mute, remains unchanged.                                  | The representative rejoins the conversation.                                                                                         | Primary service representative rejoins the call. The call status remains unchanged.                                                           | The call ends for the secondary service representative.                                                                                       | Call is transferred.

The customer remains on hold.                                  | Call ends for the secondary representative.                                                                                           | Call is rerouted if the transfer fails.                                                                                       |

### Best practices

Ensure that the service representatives using the Virtual Desktop have the latest version of the multimedia redirection extension installed on their browsers. If they don't have the latest version, representatives see error messages whenever they are in a call.
