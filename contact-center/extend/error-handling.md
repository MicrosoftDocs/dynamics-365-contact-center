# Error handling in messaging APIs

When working with the Messaging APIs, itâ€™s important to understand how errors are communicated. This helps you implement proper error handling and debugging in your applications.

The APIs return standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure, and may include detailed error messages in the response body. These error responses often follow the [RFC 7807](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807) specification for problem details in HTTP APIs.

In addition to the status code and message, failed requests include a correlation ID in the response headers that you can use for troubleshooting.


## HTTP Status Codes

| Status Code | Meaning             | Description |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 400       | Bad Request          | The request did not conform to the API contract. The response follows [RFC 7807 Problem Details](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807). |
| 401       | Unauthorized         | The token is expired, invalid, or the channel ID is not authorized for the organization. |
| 404       | Not Found            | The specified conversation ID was not found or is already closed. |
| 429       | Too Many Requests    | The request rate limit has been exceeded. The `Retry-After` header will indicate when you may retry. |
| 500       | Internal Server Error| The omnichannel service failed to process the request. |
| 503       | Service Unavailable  | The omnichannel service is temporarily unavailable. |



### Sample 400 Error (RFC 7807 Format)

```json
{
  "type": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root",
  "title": "Bad Input",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "Negative or complex numbers are not allowed."
}

```

## Error codes in response body

| Error Code | Error Message                                                               | HTTP Code |

| 30005    | The provided conversation ID is not valid.                                  | 400     |
| 30006    | The provided timestamp is not valid.                                        | 400     |
| 30007    | The page size for conversations must either be null or between 1 and 250.   | 400     |
| 30008    | The page size for messages must either be null or between 1 and 100.        | 400     |
| 30009    | The provided continuation token is invalid. Use the same token as before.   | 400     |

| 30015    | The response body wasn't serialized successfully. Contact customer support for help.                               | 500     |
| 30016    | The message activity has no text or attachments.                                  | 400     |


## Use CorrelationID for troubleshooting

Each failed response includes a header, `x-ms-correlation-id: <GUID>`, which uniquely identifies the transaction within the system. You can save this ID and share it with Microsoft support if you need help troubleshooting specific failures.
