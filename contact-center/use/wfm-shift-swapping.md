# Enable shift swapping

Shift swapping lets your customer service representatives (service representatives, representatives) exchange their bookings and provide coverage for themselves and other representatives without affecting the schedule. 

Key features include the following:

- Supervisors receive notifications via email or in-app when a swap request is accepted or rejected by agents.
- Supervisors can review and either approve or decline swap requests as part of the approval process.
- Service representatives can swap shifts 1:1 with a colleague, or post the swap request publicly for any team member to pick up.
- Representatives can receive notifications via email or in-app when the swap is accepted or rejected by a colleague.
