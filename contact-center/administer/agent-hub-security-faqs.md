# Security FAQs about AI agents

This FAQ article provides answers to common questions about the security, privacy, and compliance of AI agents in Dynamics 365 Contact Center and Customer Service.

## Security FAQs

### Do you track any metrics to assess the qualitative aspects of the model output like fluency, coherence, and relevance for summarization and descriptive statistics about input data?

Copilot uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to generate responses based on the sources used to ground its outputs. The service representative feedback is captured in the customer Dataverse instance to help assess the qualitative aspects of both the model's output and the input data.

### Do you provide any dashboard to track model performance metrics?  Or is the business planning to compute KPIs pulling data from the platform?

Generally available Copilot capabilities use proactive incident monitoring and resolution to identify and resolve outages and other issues. Microsoft follows standard incident management operating procedures for customer reported incidents. Learn more in [Support for Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps](/power-platform/admin/support-overview).

### Is the AI system rule based, learning based, or both?

It's both rule based and learning based. Copilot uses rule-based triggers to activate learning-based features. Learning-based components are driven by large language models (LLMs) and AI services like Azure OpenAI, enabling natural language understanding, summarization, and contextual suggestions that improve over time based on usage and feedback. Learn more in [Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service architecture](/dynamics365/guidance/reference-architectures/dynamics-365-customer-service-copilot-architecture).
