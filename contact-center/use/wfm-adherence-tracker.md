# Use the Adherence Tracker

## Overview

The Adherence Tracker helps supervisors monitor the activities of customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) against their scheduled shifts in real time. This tracker enables the early detection of adherence deviations, allowing supervisors to take proactive actions to maintain service levels and operational efficiency.

Use the Adherence Tracker to ensure that service representatives are where they need to be&mdash;whether working queues, on break, or attending training sessions&mdash;according to the planned schedule.

## Prerequisites

Your administrator installed the Workforce Management for Customer Service package in the Power Platform admin center app, and then enabled the feature in Copilot Service admin center.

## Access the real-time adherence tracker

1. In the site map of the Copilot Service workspace center app, go to **Workforce management**, and then select **Adherence Tracker**. The **Adherence tracker** page appears.
1. Filter by **Time Zone** and **Shift Plan** to narrow your view to representatives you want to track.
