The success of social media customer service, like all other customer services, depends on the quality of customer care provided. Communications from agents should be timely, accurate, sensitive, brief, and friendly, which ultimately improves customer satisfaction and brand loyalty. To enhance customer satisfaction and improve communications, the omnichannel capability in the application enables you to send and receive WhatsApp messages using [Azure Communication Services](/azure/communication-services). You can use the WhatsApp channel feature to engage in conversations with customers for product inquiry and customer service scenarios with those who prefer to communicate using WhatsApp. 


## Prerequisites

- Channels are provisioned in your environment. Learn more in [provision channels](../implement/provision-channels.md).
- You have an Azure account with an active subscription. Make sure that the Azure subscription and Dynamics 365 account are in the same tenant. Learn more at [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account).
   - Create or use an existing Azure Communication Services resource. Learn more in [Create and manage Communication Services resources](/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource).
    - Obtain a phone number that can send and receive SMS. You have several options:
       - Purchase a phone number or import one from Azure Communication Services. Learn more in [Get and manage phone number](/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number) or [import phone numbers](/dynamics365/customer-service/administer/voice-channel-sync-from-acs?context=/dynamics365/contact-center/context/administer-context).

       -    Migrate your existing WhatsApp business accounts with phone number.
   - Set up Advanced Messaging for WhatsApp. Learn more in [Advanced Messaging for WhatsApp in Azure Communication Services](/azure/communication-services/concepts/advanced-messaging/whatsapp/whatsapp-overview) and [Register WhatsApp business account](/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/advanced-messaging/whatsapp/connect-whatsapp-business-account).

1. Select the checkbox to confirm that the WhatsApp channel is set up correctly, and then select **Done**.
               
## Create a workstream for the WhatsApp channel

To configure routing and work distribution, you can create a [workstream](/dynamics365/customer-service/administer/create-workstreams?context=/dynamics365/contact-center/context/administer-context) with the **Channel** set to **WhatsApp** or select an existing one.

### Set up WhatsApp message templates

WhatsApp has a constraint known as the 24-hour window. If a WhatsApp user has sent a message, whether it's a communication they initiated or a reply to one of your messages, you have a 24-hour window to send that user messages that don't need to use a template. After the 24-hour window closes, your messages must use an approved template.

You must create WhatsApp message templates before you can add them to your WhatsApp workstream. Learn more in [Send WhatsApp template messages](/azure/communication-services/concepts/advanced-messaging/whatsapp/template-messages). Only text-based message templates can be added to your workstream.

1. In the admin center, edit the WhatsApp workstream.

1. On the **Behaviors** page, under **WhatsApp message templates**, select **Add**.

1. Enter a **Name** for the template.

1. Select the **Default language** from the list.

1. Copy the text from the template that you created in WhatsApp and paste it in **WhatsApp approved text**.

1. Select **Save**.

You can create as many templates as you require.
