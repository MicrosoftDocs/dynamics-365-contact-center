# Set up customer intent agents in Microsoft Copilot studio

With the help of customer intent agents, bot owners no longer need to create and author bots to work for intent. It also takes away the effort of creating a bunch of manual bot topics that could be deprecated.

Customer intent agent discovers historical data and maintains an up-to-date intent library, along with the attributes to support intent determination, interview, and fulfillment, leading to much higher deflection.

## Prerequisites

- **Customer Intent Agent** is enabled.
- Make sure that you have a system administrator role. (Please info on any other roles/licenses that may be required)

## Here's how it works

- An administrator sets up intent, harvests historical data to build intent library, and enables the library for customer intent agents and customer service representatives. The administrator also enables knowledge harvesting and connects to the customer intent agent.
- Customer intent agent detects intent from the customer, asks follow-up questions related to the intent, and provides a solution based on customer provided information from the connected customer intent agent knowledge source.
- If issue is escalated, it's transferred to agents and the agent persists intent and interview questions generated by customer intent agents, goes through unanswered questions with customer, and gets an updated solution.
- Once the issue is closed, a new knowledge article for the undocumented resolved issue is harvested, along with new intent attributes for use in self service.
- The supervisor approves and publishes the article, and it's made available in the knowledge source that the Copilot Studio bot is connected to.
- The system also harvests this conversation to detect any updates, and discovers new intent attributes that can be used in future interviews.
- In the next customer interaction with a customer intent agent, the customer intent agent can self service the customer issue with the newly harvested knowledge and intent, and provide a tailored response without any agent involvement.

## Set up

1.	In Customer Service admin center, go to **Customer Support** > **Intent**. The **Customer Intent Agent (preview)** page appears.
1.	On the **Customer Intent Agent (preview)** page, switch the **Turn on Customer Intent Agent** toggle to **On**.
1.	In the Intent discovery section, enable the following:
    1.	**Manage intent discovery setup**. Learn more in (Neeraja’s admin doc)
    1.	**Manage intent groups and intents**. Learn more in (Neeraja’s admin doc)	
1.	In the **Intent-based suggestions** section, select **Enable for chatbots** and then select **Manage**. The **Bots** page appears.
1.	Select the customer service bot connected to your omnichannel environment for agent transfers.
1.	Select **Add intent-based features**. This takes you to Copilot Studio.
1.	Select **Customer Service Copilot Bot in Copilot**, and then select **Component collections** in **Settings**.
1.	In **Manage component collections**, **Follow-up suggestions** appears by default in the list to be added to the Copilot.
1.	Select **Add to copilot**. 

## Disconnect a bot to stop agent transfers from that bot (Need info)

You can also disconnect a bot to stop agent transfers for that bot.
