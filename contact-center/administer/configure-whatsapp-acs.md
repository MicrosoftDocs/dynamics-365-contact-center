The success of social media customer service, like all other customer services, depends on the quality of customer care provided. Communications from agents should be timely, accurate, sensitive, brief, and friendly, which ultimately improves customer satisfaction and brand loyalty. To enhance customer satisfaction and improve communications, the omnichannel capability in the application enables you to send and receive WhatsApp messages using [Azure Communication Services](/azure/communication-services). You can use the WhatsApp channel feature to engage in conversations with customers for product inquiry and customer service scenarios with those who prefer to communicate using WhatsApp. 


## Prerequisites

- Make sure channels are provisioned in your environment. Learn more in [provision channels](../implement/provision-channels.md).
- Have an Azure account with an active subscription. Make sure that the Azure subscription and Dynamics 365 account are in the same tenant. Learn more at [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account).
   - Create or use an existing Azure Communication Services resource. Learn more at [Create and manage Communication Services resources](/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource).
    - Obtain a phone number that can send and receive SMS. The following are supported:
       - Purchase a [phone number](/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number) or [import phone numbers](/dynamics365/customer-service/administer/voice-channel-sync-from-acs?context=/dynamics365/contact-center/context/administer-context)
       - [Bring your own phone number from existing providers](/dynamics365/customer-service/administer/voice-channel-bring-your-own-number?context=/dynamics365/contact-center/context/administer-context) or migrate your existing WhatsApp business accounts with phone number.
   - [Advanced Messaging for WhatsApp](/azure/communication-services/concepts/advanced-messaging/whatsapp/whatsapp-overview) is set up in Azure Communication Services. Perform the steps in [register WhatsApp business account](/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/advanced-messaging/whatsapp/connect-whatsapp-business-account).
   - Configure [Event Grid](/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/advanced-messaging/whatsapp/handle-advanced-messaging-events) with Microsoft Entra app authentication.
