# Create a time-off request

As a customer service representative, you can use time-off requests to help you manage your work-life balance. When you submit a time-off request, your manager receives a request notification for their review and approval. Time-off requests can help your manager plan for how to cover your shifts when while you're away.

## Create a time-off request

1. In the site map of Copilot Service workspace, select **Request Management** under **Workforce Management**. The **All Active Requests** page appears.
1. Select **New**, and then select **Time Off** from the dropdown menu. If you don't see the option, select the ellipsis. The **New WEM Request** page appears.
1. On the **Details** card, enter the details as follows:
      - **Is Full Day**: If the request is for a full day, set the toggle to **Yes**.
      - **Start**: Select the date you want to be the first day of your time off. If you aren't requesting a full day, also select the begin time from the dropdown menu.
      - **End**: Select the date you want to be the last day of your time off. If you aren't requesting a full day, also select the end time from the dropdown menu.
      - **Time Off Type**: Select the type of time off you want to request.
      - **Hours**: If you aren't requesting a full day off, the hours field populates automatically based on your **Start** and **End** selections.
      - **Notes**: Type a note if desired.
1. Select **Save**. Your manager receives a notification of your request.
