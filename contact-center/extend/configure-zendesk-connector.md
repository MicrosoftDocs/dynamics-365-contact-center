# Configure the connector for Zendesk

The Microsoft Contact Centerâ€”Power Automate solution for Zendesk connector allows organizations to engage with their customers using capabilities such as voice, video, SMS, live chat, and social messaging from their non Microsoft CRM solutions. You can use Power Automate data connectors to sync the contacts and accounts data from the Zendesk CRM solution into Dataverse.

## Prerequisites 

-  A Zendesk `https://<your_subdomain>.zendesk.com` instance
- License for Dynamic 365 Contact Center that includes the Power Automate and Power Apps subscriptions.
- Power Platform System administrator permissions
- Basic understanding of how to use Power Automate flows or Power Apps
- Ensure that the Power Apps and Power Automate environments are the same.
- The Dynamics 365 CCaaS CRM Connector, **msdyn_ContactCenterCRMConnector**, is available in the Power Apps environment and the Account and Contact tables have the following columns:
    - Source CRM
    - Source CRM ID
    - Source CRM URL

## Import Power Automate flows to sync Account and Contact records

Perform the steps in the following sections import the Power Automate flows for Zendesk.

**Add a Zendesk connector**

1. Follow the steps in [Add a connection](/power-automate/add-manage-connections#add-a-connection) to add a Zendesk connection.
1. Specify your Zendesk domain, and then select **Create**.
1. In the pop-up window, sign in with your Zendesk credentials.
1. In the pop-up window that appears, select **Allow** to Power Platform to access your Zendesk account. A connection is created.

**Add a Dataverse Connector**

1. Follow the steps in [Add a connection](/power-automate/add-manage-connections#add-a-connection) to add a Dataverse connection, and then select **Create**.
1. In the pop-up window that appears, select your account. A connection is created.

**Download flows from GitHub**
 
Download all the Power Automate flows from the [Zendesk](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-for-service/tree/CCaaS-3P-CRM-Connector/flows/Zendesk) repository.

**Import flows to Power Automate**

1. In Power Automate, select **My flows**.
1. In **Import**, select **Import** and then select **Import Package (legacy)**.  
1. Select the downloaded flows and then select **Upload**.
1. In the **Import package** window, for the Microsoft Dataverse resource type, select **Select during import** and then select the Dataverse connection that you created and then select **Save**.
1. The connection is displayed on the Import page. Select **Import**.
1. The imported flows are displayed in the **My flows** page. The flows are disabled by default. For the flow you want to enables, select the more items (ellipsis) and then select **Turn on** to enable them.

## Configure incremental data sync

Incremental data sync updates the Zendesk data to Dataverse in real-time through automated triggers.

You must update the credentials in the Power Automate flows to connect them to your Zendesk account. For all the incremental automated-triggered flows such as create, delete, and update, perform the following steps: 

1. In Power Automate **Cloud flows** select the ZendeskCreateUserAPICall, ZendeskUpdateUserAPICall, and ZendeskCreateOrgHttp flows and then select **Edit**. Perform the following actions:    
  - Update the subdomain in the **URI** section with your Zendesk subdomain.
  - Update the **Method** to **GET**
1. Select **Authentication** in **Advanced parameters**, and specify the following:
   - Authentication Type: **Basic**
   - Specify your Zendesk credentials in the **Username** and **Password** fields.
1. Sign in to the Zendesk instance.
1. In the Zendesk Admin Center page, select **Apps and integration**. Select the **Zendesk API** option and then enable the **Password access** toggle.
1. Select **Save**.

## Configure Webhooks 

Set up webhooks in Zendesk to facilitate incremental data synchronization. Webhooks trigger notifications upon the creation, update, or deletion of a record. Name the flows to reflect the operation such as create, update, delete and the entity involved such as org, user. For example, `ZendeskCreateOrgHttp`. 

**Retrieve endpoint**

To create webhooks, ensure you have the HTTP endpoint for the Power Automate flow. Perform the following steps to get the endpoint in Power Automate: 

1. Select the required flow and then select **Edit**. 
1. Select **Manual** in the flow, and then copy the HTTP URL. Repeat the steps for the organization and user flows for all the create, update, and delete operations.

**Add endpoint to Zendesk**

1. Sign in to your Zendesk instance and then select Admin center. 
1. Select **Apps and Integrations** > **Webhooks**. Perform the steps in [create a webhook](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408839108378-Creating-webhooks-to-interact-with-third-party-systems#:~:text=To%20create%20a%20webhook,event%20types%20from%20the%20dropdown) to create a webhook.
1. Select **Create webhook**.
1. For organization events, in the Create webhook page, select the following options in **Organization events**:
    -  **Support Organization Created** to create an organization, and then select **Next**.
    - **Support Organization name changed** to update the organization, and then select **Next**. 
    - **Support Organization deleted** to delete the organization, and then select **Next**. 
1. For user events, in the Create webhook page, select the following options in **User events**:
    -  **Support user Created** to create a user, and then select **Next**. 
    - **Any user events** to update a user, and then select **Next**. 
    - **Support user deleted** to delete users, and then select **Next**. 
1. Specify a name and update the **Endpoint URL** field with the endpoint copied from Power Automate flow.
1. Select **Test Webhook**, and then select **Send Test**. If you get a 202 Accepted response, the webhook is configured successfully. 

## Run The Power Automate Flow 

In Power Automate, select the required flow, and then select **Run**. 

> [!NOTE]

## Edit flows and field mappings (Optional)

1. Select **Edit**.
