# Set up capacity planning

To have the right number of customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) available at the right time is critical to deliver exceptional customer service while optimizing costs. With capacity planning, you can forecast staffing requirements based on historical and expected demand. This feature helps you maintain service levels without over or understaffing.

Capacity planning helps supervisors model different demand scenarios based on forecasted volumes and analyze staffing needs by channel and queue. Whether you're planning for the next few weeks or months ahead, capacity planning provides the visibility and flexibility needed to help you make informed staffing decisions.

## Prerequisites

1. Install the **Workforce Management for Customer Service** package in the Power Platform admin center app. Once installed, you can create forecast scenarios based on your operational needs.
1. Set up your user profiles:
     1. In the site map of the Copilot Service admin center app, go to **Operations**, and then select **Workforce management**. The **Workforce management** page appears.
     1. In **Workforce setup**, select **View** next to **User management**.
