# Use evaluation plan

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Evaluations for conversations is a preview feature and is available in Dynamics 365 Contact Center only. 
> - Preview features arenâ€™t meant for production use and might have restricted functionality. These features are subject to [supplemental terms of use](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2189520), and are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.

Evaluation plans help supervisors ensure consistent and objective reviews of cases and conversations. By defining criteria, methods, and conditions, evaluation plans support both manual and AI-driven assessments. This article describes how to create, activate, and manage evaluation plans, and enable bulk evaluations to streamline your review process.

## Prerequisites

- You have the required [Roles and privileges](../administer/manage-quality-evaluation-agent.md#role-and-privileges)
- You have [set up a pay-as-you-go plan](/dynamics365/customer-service/administer/setup-pay-as-you-go?context=/dynamics365/contact-center/context/administer-context).
- You provided consent for potential [data movement across regions](../administer/manage-quality-evaluation-agent.md#data-movement-across-regions).
