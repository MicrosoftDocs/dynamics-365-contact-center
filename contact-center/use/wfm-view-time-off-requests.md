# View and approve time-off requests

You can view and approve or reject time-off requests on the active requests page, including the representative name, request type, status, and date the request was created.

## View and take action on a time-off request

1. On the Copilot Service workspace site map, select **Request Management** under **Workforce Management**. The **All Active Requests** page appears, and shows a list of all requests.
1. Select the time-off request you want to take action on from the list. The request page appears, where you can view the details of the time off, include start, end, time-off type, total hours, and any notes the service representative entered.
1. Select **Approve** to approve the request, or **Reject** to reject the request. If notifications are enabled in your organization, a notification is sent to the representative.
