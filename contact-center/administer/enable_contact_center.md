# Enable intent-based suggestions for customer service representatives

For agents to be able to use intent-based suggestions for live chat and persistent conversations, you need to enable **Intent-based suggestions (preview)** in agent experience profiles. By default, agents added to the out-of-the-box agent experience profiles can use the intent-based suggestions.

You can create a custom agent experience profile and enable the required features to limit the features agents can use. You can then assign the custom profile to the agents.

Perform the following steps to add the Copilot features to an agent experience profile:

1. Go to Agent experience profiles using one of the following navigation options:
   - **Agent experience** > **Workspaces**
   - **Intent > Agent access** > **Customer Intent Agent (preview)** > **Enable for support representatives**
1. Select the required agent experience profile.
1. On the Productivity Pane, turn on the **Copilot help pane** toggle so that agents can use ask a question.
1. In the **Copilot AI features** section, select edit and then select the required **Intent-based suggestions(preview)**
