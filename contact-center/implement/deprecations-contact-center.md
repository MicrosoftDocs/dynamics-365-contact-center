# Deprecations in Dynamics 365 Contact Center

The deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Contact Center are listed in this article.

Administrators and IT professionals can use this information to prepare for future releases.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> "Deprecated" means we intend to remove the feature or capability in a major future release. The feature or capability will continue to work and will be fully supported until it's officially removed. This deprecation notification might span a few years. After removal, the feature or capability won't work. We're informing you now to give you enough time to adjust and update your code before the feature or capability is removed.

## Post-call survey setting on Language tab of voice workstream is deprecated

Effective August 1, 2025, the post-call survey toggle currently found in the voice workstream > **Language** tab in Copilot Service admin center is deprecated and removed. We recommend that you configure post-call surveys using [Configure feedback surveys using Copilot Studio (preview)](../administer/configure-surveys.md#enable-the-post-call-survey-for-the-voice-channel).

## Draft a chat response (preview) is deprecated

The draft a chat response (preview) feature is deprecated as of July 01, 2025. The support for the feature will be removed on July 14, 2025.

## Deprecation of local hosting support for the voice channel

The deprecation schedule of the local hosting capabilities for the legacy voice channel is as follows: 

- **Switzerland**: Effective October 31, 2024
- **India and Japan**: Effective September 09, 2024 

For the existing legacy voice installations, the deprecation is the first step toward transitioning to the enhanced voice experience. To continue using the voice channel, you should explore the global cloud deployment option in the nearest geographic location, subject to your country or region laws for using the voice channel in Dynamics 365 Contact Center.
