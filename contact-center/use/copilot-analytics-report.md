Copilot helps customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) to complete tasks related to conversations and email more easily. With the Copilot report, supervisors and customer service managers can identify the effect that Copilot is having across their customer service operation.


The system stores the copilot interaction data in the [msdyn_copilotinteraction](/dynamics365/customer-service/develop/reference/entities/msdyn_copilotinteraction), [msdyn_copilotinteractiondata](/dynamics365/customer-service/develop/reference/entities/msdyn_copilotinteractiondata), [msdyn_copilottranscript](/dynamics365/customer-service/develop/reference/entities/msdyn_copilottranscript), and [msdyn_copilottranscriptdata](/dynamics365/customer-service/develop/reference/entities/msdyn_copilottranscriptdata) tables. You can use the information to build custom metrics in reporting and analytics and understand how Copilot is being used in your organization.

To view the Copilot report, select **Copilot analytics** from the Copilot Service workspace menu.

## Copilot report

You can use filters to focus on the information that's important to you:

- **Duration**: Filters the data by the selected value of day, week, or month.
- **Time zone**: Filters the data for the selected time zone.

The Copilot report displays the following metrics.
