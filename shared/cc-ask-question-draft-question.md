You can ask free-form questions just as you'd ask your colleague or supervisor who might know the answers.

With Copilot, you can take the following actions:

- **Ask a direct question**: Copilot shows the most relevant answer from the knowledge sources that your organization has provided. Based on the context of the question, Copilot proactively suggests prompts that you can use to ask follow-up questions or get more details.
- **Ask follow-up turn by turn questions**: If Copilot's response isn't immediately useful, you can ask follow-up questions and guide Copilot in a natural, conversational way.
- **Ask Copilot to attempt a better response**: Copilot can also rephrase responses based on more guidance such as, "Can you summarize your response?" or "Can you attempt a response providing details for each of the steps you mentioned?"
