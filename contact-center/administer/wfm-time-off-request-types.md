# Configure time-off request types

You can configure time-off request types to help customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives), supervisors, and schedulers in your organization handle leave requests in an efficient and organized manner. 

Key features include:

- Service representatives can submit time-off requests directly from their schedule views and view approved requests in their schedule calendar.
- Supervisors can receive time-off requests via email or in-app alerts, and manage them in the Request Management view.
- Schedulers can stay informed of approvals through notifications, and view time-off bookings in the schedule view.

## Prerequisites

- Complete the steps in [Set up user management](wfm-user-management.md).
- For service representatives to be able to submit their time off requests, make sure that they're assigned to the correct manager.
