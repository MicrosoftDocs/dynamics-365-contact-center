## Summarize cases

You can also generate case summaries directly within the Ask a question tab. Learn more in [Summarize cases in non-Microsoft CRMs](copilot-use-summary.md).

## Generate resolution notes

Copilot generates resolution notes based on the case details, emails, and notes linked to the case to help you close the case or incident faster. The generated resolution summary includes the issue, root cause, troubleshooting steps, and resolution provided. You can copy the summary, refresh it, and provide feedback.

1. Select the required case.
1. Select the embedded Copilot. The Copilot help pane appears.
1. In the **Ask a question** tab, select **Generate resolution notes**. The conversation summary appears as a card in the help pane.
