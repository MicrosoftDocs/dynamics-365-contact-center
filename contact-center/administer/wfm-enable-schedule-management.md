# Enable schedule management to improve customer service

Schedule management lets you organize service activities for your customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives). It offers you the following benefits:

- Ensures that representatives are scheduled optimally and efficiently to avoid disruptions in service.
- Helps your organization improve the quality of service for your customers.

## Prerequisites

Complete the steps in [Set up user management](wfm-user-management.md).
    
## Enable schedule management

1.	In the site map of the Copilot Service admin center app, go to **Operations**, and then select **Workforce management**. The **Workforce management** page appears.
1.	In **Shift & Schedule Management**, select **Manage** next to **Schedule Management**.
1.	On the **Schedule management** page, set the **Allow agents to accept schedule** toggle to **On**.
3.	For **Schedule acceptance deadline (days)**, set the number of days for a service representative to be able to accept their schedule.
    > [!Note]
    > If the representative doesn't accept or reject within the deadline, then the system sets the schedule to rejected status automatically.
4.	Select **Save and Close**.
