# Proactive Outbound dashboard

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-cc-only](../includes/cc-feature-availability-cc-only.md)]

The Proactive Outbound dashboard in Omnichannel historical analytics tracks conversation metrics and monitors ongoing conversations, through conversation direction (incoming or outgoing) and conversation type. The dashboard provides organizations with detailed insights into outbound customer engagements initiated through proactive outreach. The dashboard is designed to help teams monitor, analyze, and optimize outbound conversation strategies, ensuring higher delivery rates and improved customer experiences. The dashboard shows delivery status, result, and dial mode, enabling quick identification of trends and bottlenecks. Delivery metrics are segmented by proactive engagement configuration, queue, and date, allowing for granular analysis and targeted improvements.

Users can apply out-of-box filters, such as duration, channel, queue, proactive engagement configuration, and time zone, to refine data for targeted analysis.

## Panel filters

The dashboard is prefiltered by the default panel filters **Conversation type** and **Conversation direction** to show outbound  interactions only.
