# Write an email with Copilot

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../includes/cc-feature-availability.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cc-ask-question-proprompt](../../shared/cc-write-email-intro.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Your administrator has enabled this feature.
- You have the required permissions to use Copilot.

## Navigation

 In Copilot Service workspace, you can access **Ask a question** from the Copilot help pane after you sign in.

## Use Copilot to draft an email

You can use Copilot in the email editor or use the predefined prompts in the Copilot help pane to draft an email. 

  ### [Draft an email in the rich text editor](#tab/richtexteditor)

  When you use Copilot to draft an email, you can use the following features to help you write a response to a customer.

 **Use prompts**

 You can use the predefined prompts to generate email drafts in the **Write an email** tab of the Copilot help pane:

[!INCLUDE [cc-write-email-prompts](../../shared/cc-write-email-prompts.md)]

  **Use Copilot recommended email templates**

  When you respond to an email linked to a case, in the email editor, the **Draft with Copilot** card appears. In the card, service representatives can specify a prompt with context about the email draft Copilot should generate. For example, a prompt can be “Write an email about documents required for account verification”.

  Copilot automatically selects the most appropriate email template and inserts it in the email editor, based on your prompt and the email context. If the email template contains a pre-configured prompt, Copilot automatically generates the draft based on the prompt text when you insert a template. Parts of the email generated by Copilot is clearly marked with a distinct visual element.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can use Copilot recommended email templates only when there's no text in the email editor. If there's text in the editor, Copilot generates an email draft without using an email template.

  If the draft is satisfactory, you can select **Keep it** to use it as-is.

  Copilot displays the email template used to generate the draft. You can select **Choose a different template** if the template isn’t appropriate. The following actions are applicable:
   - The **Copilot recommended templates** dialog appears.
   - The system displays five email templates that Copilot recommends based on the context of email. 
   - You can select one of the templates recommended by Copilot or manually search for and insert an email template. Learn more in [Enhanced email template selection dialog](/power-apps/user/insert-email-template#enhanced-email-template-selection-dialog).
   - Multi-turn responses and **Use knowledge base** toggle aren't applicable when Copilot generates an email draft using the email template.

  **Generate partial email drafts using Copilot**

  You can use Copilot inline email assist to generate a partial draft instead of generating a whole email draft. You can use this feature to generate a response to a specific part of the email or to add more details to an existing email draft.

  Perform the following steps to generate the partial draft:

  1. Insert your cursor where you want to generate partial text in the email body and then select **Draft with Copilot**. The **Draft with Copilot** card appears. 
  1. Specify the prompt for Copilot to generate a partial draft. For example, "Add a personal statement of empathy".
  1. Select **Generate**. Copilot generates the partial draft. You can use it as-is or adjust the draft before adding it to the email.
  1. You can also turn on the **Use knowledge base** toggle to use knowledge base sources to generate the draft.

 **Use follow-up prompts**

 If you aren't satisfied with Copilot's response, you can use follow-up custom prompts and guide Copilot in a natural, conversational way. You can use up to five prompts at a time to refine the email draft. If the knowledge base is enabled, Copilot also uses those sources.

  
### [Draft an email in the Copilot help pane](#tab/copilothelppane)

  You can select **Filters** to choose the relevant knowledge articles only that Copilot must use to generate the response.

 **Use prompts**

 You can use the predefined prompts to generate email drafts in the **Write an email** tab of the Copilot help pane:

[!INCLUDE [cc-write-email-prompts](../../shared/cc-write-email-prompts.md)]

 > [!NOTE]
 > - If the knowledge base isn't enabled, you see the **Suggest a call**, **Request more information**, **Empathize with feedback**, and **Custom** prompts only.
 > - If you've left the **Regarding** field empty, you see the **Suggest a call**, **Empathize with feedback**, and **Custom** prompts only.

### How Copilot uses knowledge base and web sources

If your administrator enabled knowledge sources and set up trusted domains, the following actions occur:
-  Copilot uses internal knowledge base sources and searches the internal knowledge base and up to five trusted domains to generate email drafts. 
- The application displays the knowledge sources used to generate the draft when you select **Check sources**.
- When you use a custom prompt to further refine the response, the application displays the **Use knowledge base** toggle that's set to **On**. You can switch the toggle to **Off** to disable knowledge base sources.
