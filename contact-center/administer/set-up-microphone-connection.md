# Set up microphone connection on representative sign-in

You can enable the application to pre-acquire the customer service representative’s (service representatives or representatives) microphone as soon as they sign in to the environment—before any calls begin, reducing latency and improving call connection times, creating a smoother experience for both service representatives and customers.

## Enable microphone to be connected to the app

To enable the microphone to be connected to the app, perform the following steps in Copilot Service admin center:

1. Select **Support experience** > **Workspaces**.
1. On the **Workspaces** page, select **Manage** for **Voice call experiences**.
1. Turn on the **Allow microphone to be connected to the app after signing in** toggle. This toggle is turned off by default.
1. Select **Save**.


## Runtime experience

When a service representative signs in to an environment, their microphone is connected to the environment. The microphone remains active in the background until the service representative signs out or closes the browser, reducing the latency due to the connection process.
