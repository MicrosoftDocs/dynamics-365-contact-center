# Use the Desktop companion application with the voice channel (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]


The Desktop companion application serves as a backup when the Dynamics 365 Customer Service or Dynamics 365 Contact Center web application encounters issues and allows you to continue conversations without interruption.

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

## Prerequisites

- The Desktop companion application is installed on your desktop.


## Using the Desktop Companion Application

After you sign in to Contact Center or Customer Service and you receive a call, you can launch the Desktop companion application from the windows toolbar to continue the conversation from the web browser.

Launch the application if you face issues such as network latency, web application freezes or reloads, or to ensure that your headset and wireless devices stay connected.
