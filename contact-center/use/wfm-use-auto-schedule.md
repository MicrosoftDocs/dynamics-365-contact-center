# Use auto schedule to schedule service representatives

If you have many customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) to schedule activities for, use the auto scheduler on the schedule board to quickly create a shift plan.

## Use auto schedule

1. In the site map of Copilot Service workspace, select **Shift planning** in **Workforce Management**. The **My Shift Plans** page appears.
1. Select the shift plan you want to use to book the representatives, and then select **Schedule people** on the task bar. The shift scheduler board appears.
2. Select the **Schedule** dropdown menu, and then select **Auto-Schedule**. The **Auto-Schedule Criteria** pane appears.
1. For **Duration**, select the start and end dates for the activity.
1. Set the filters for **Agent availability**, **Match Skills**, and **Match Queue** as required.
1. Set the **Availability order** to either **Most Available to Least** or **Least Available to Most**.
1. Select **Schedule**. The schedule board updates and fills the activities for the agents in the activity itinerary.
1. Select **Publish**. The system sends a booking notification to the representatives who are scheduled.
