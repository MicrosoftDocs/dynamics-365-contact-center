When you select one of the predefined prompts, Copilot generates a suggested reply that's displayed on the UI incrementally. You can also see the inline citations that show the knowledge base or website links from which Copilot drew the response. When you hover over the citation, you can see an inline link to the source. You can select **Stop Responding** to stop Copilot from generating the email draft. The application displays the prompts for you to start over.
