This article answers your most frequently asked questions about the free product trial of Customer Service and Omnichannel for Customer Service.

[!INCLUDE [trial-platform-faqs](~/../includes/ce/shared/trials/trial-faq-platform.md)]

### Can I convert the trial to a paid license?

Yes, you can purchase licenses through direct, credit card purchase at admin.microsoft.com. Or, you can work with sales to establish a volume licensing or enterprise agreement. Visit our [Pricing page](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/pricing/) for more information on pricing and purchasing.

To purchase the license using an existing account, work with the administrator of the account to apply for licenses.

After you apply for the license to your tenant, you can publish your environment to production. You can remove the sample data. However, you must manually reset the configuration and remove any test data that you added. We recommend that you create a fresh environment to use for your production environment and add the configurations you want to move forward with.

### What are the trial limits and quotas?

The following limitations apply for the trial:

- The trial is available to you for 30 days. After that, you can request an extension for another 30 days, buy a paid license, or sign up for a new trial.
- The trial expires if thereâ€™s no activity on the app for 14 consecutive days. Expired trials can't be reactivated. However, you can start a new trial.
- You can have only one active trial per app at a time. You can sign up again after your current trial for the app ends.

## Dynamics 365 Contact Center-specific questions

  - Chat, voice, and other digital messaging channels

### How do I remove sample data from the trial instance?

Your trial environment is curated to provide you with a fully functional application to ensure you can discover the business value of Contact Center right away. Sample data is available to ensure all features are fully illustrated for you. You can learn how the product works as if it were deployed to many users in your organization and with existing customer interactions. Because it's a real environment, you can manually add or delete individual data records in your trial environment as you want. You can't do a bulk delete of the sample data and configurations from the trial environments.

### How do I reset or reimport sample data?

Sample data comes with the trial environment and experience. To get a fresh dataset, you must wait for your trial to expire and start a new trial.

### Can I call the trial phone number from outside the US?

No, you can't call the trial phone number because it's a toll-free US number that works within the US only. For more information and a workaround, refer to [Use trial phone numbers](/dynamics365/customer-service/administer/voice-channel-trial-phone-numbers).

### Can I use the trial phone numbers for inbound or outbound SMS?
