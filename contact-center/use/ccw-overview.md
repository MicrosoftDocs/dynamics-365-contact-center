# Overview of Contact Center workspace

The Contact Center workspace application provides a powerful agent desktop with Copilot capabilities and collaboration tools across channels like live chat, SMS, voice, Microsoft Teams, and social channels. Contact Center connects to your organization's customer relationship manager (CRM) solution to provide contextual knowledge and customer data to assist agents in resolving customer queries. As an agent, you can have simultaneous customer sessions within the app without losing the context of each session. You can also use Copilot within Contact Center workspace to ask questions pertaining to a case, removing the need to manually search across multiple knowledge sources.

## Prerequisites

You must have the Omnichannel Agent role.

## Access the app

The app is automatically installed in all the Dynamics 365 Contact Center organizations. You can sign in to Dynamics 365, and on the apps page, select Contact Center workspace.
