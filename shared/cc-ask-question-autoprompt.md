When you have an active case or conversation open, Copilot suggests prompts based on the context of the case or the conversation. Copilot generates prompts for the first question only. Copilot generates the prompts as follows:

- For a case, Copilot considers the title, description, notes, and emails linked to the case.
- For a conversation, Copilot considers the intent in the first three messages to generate a prompt, and then every third message to refresh the prompts. You can select a prompt to generate a response.
