# View and take action on time-off requests

You can view and approve or reject time-off requests from customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) on the active requests page. The page shows details that include the representative name, request type, status, and date that the representative created the request.

## View and take action on a time-off request

1. In the site map of Copilot Service workspace, select **Request Management** under **Workforce Management**. The **All Active Requests** page appears and shows a list of all requests.
1. Select the time-off request you want to take action on from the list. The request page appears, where you can view the details of the time off, that includes the start, end, time-off type, total hours, and any notes the service representative enters.
1. Select **Approve** or **Reject**.  If notifications are enabled in your organization, a notification is sent to the representative.
