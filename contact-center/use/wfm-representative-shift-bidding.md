# Use shift bidding to select shifts

Shift bidding allows you to select your shifts through a bidding process. Supervisors release shift plans for bidding, detailing available shifts, and then you can submit bids based on your preferred working hours. Shifts are assigned based on the best match.  Once notified, you can confirm your assigned shifts.

## Use shift bidding

1. In the site map of Copilot Service workspace, select **Request Management** under **Workforce Management**. The **All Active Requests** page appears and shows a list of all the requests.
1. Select **New**, and then select **Shift Bid**. The **New WEM Request** page appears.
1. On the **Shift Plan To Bid** card, select the shift plan you want to bid on.
1. Review the bid request details, and then select **Save**.
