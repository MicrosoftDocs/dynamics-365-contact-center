# Overview of Contact Center workspace

The Dynamics 365 Contact Center workspace application provides a powerful agent desktop with Copilot capabilities and collaboration tools across channels like live chat, SMS, voice, Microsoft Teams, and social channels. Contact Center connects to your organization's CRM to provide contextual knowledge and customer data to assist agents in resolving customer queries. As an agent, you can have simultaneous customer sessions within the app without losing the context of each session. You can also use Copilot within Contact Center to ask questions pertaining to a case, removing the need to manually search across multiple knowledge sources.
