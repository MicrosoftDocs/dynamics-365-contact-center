# Ask a question

## Summarize cases and ask about case data

Based on the app you are using, you can use Copilot to generate case summary and ask about case data from the **Ask a question** tab.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Case summaries and case data are available only if case management is available. If you are using the Customer Service Hub app, you can use Copilot to ask questions about cases, but not to summarize them.

 In Copilot Service workspace, Copilot enables you to:

- **Ask to summarize cases** (preview): Copilot generates case summaries directly within the Ask a question tab, allowing you to access them without disrupting your current workflow. The case summary includes key information such as the case title, customer, priority, case type, and description.
- **Ask about case data** (preview): Copilot enables you to access and use case data effectively, resulting in improved case management. You can ask questions about your case data to manage case workload in a better way.

You can make the following types of requests:

- Get details on the high-priority cases for a specified date range.
- Show all high-priority cases.
- Show active escalated cases.
- Show cases that are due soon.
- Show cases due the next day.
- Show active cases that service representatives own.
- Show my active cases.
- Get the case details.
- Get the case resolution details for a case.
- Show cases for owner {owner name}.
- Show case history.
