# Configure the connector for custom CRM solution

The Microsoft Contact Center â€” Power Automate solution for third party custom CRM connector allows organizations to engage with their customers using capabilities such as voice, video, SMS, live chat, and social messaging from their third-party CRM solutions. You can use Power Automate data connectors to sync the contacts and accounts data from the custom CRM solution into Dataverse.

## Prerequisites 

-  A custom CRM instance
- License for Dynamic 365 Contact Center, that include the Power Automate and Power Apps subscriptions.
- Power Platform System administrator permissions
- Basic understanding of how to use Power Automate flows or Power Apps
- Ensure that the Power Apps and Power Automate environments are the same.
- The Dynamics 365 CCaaS CRM Connector, **msdyn_ContactCenterCRMConnector**, is available in the Power Apps environment and the Account and Contact tables have the following columns:
    - Source CRM
    - Source CRM ID
    - Source CRM URL

## Data migration

You can migrate data from your custom CRM to Dataverse in the following way:

- **Initial sync**: Migrate data from CRM to Dataverse through manual triggers. We recommend that you use [pagination](/power-automate/dataverse/list-rows?tabs=classic-designer) as Power Automate connectors have a limit on the number of records that can be fetched at a time.
- **Incremental sync**: Migrate data through automated triggers.

## Import Power Automate flows to sync Account and Contact records

Perform the steps outlined in the sections that follow.

### Add a Dataverse Connector

1. Follow the steps in [Add a connection](/power-automate/add-manage-connections#add-a-connection) to add a Dataverse connection, and then select **Create**.
1. In the pop-up window that appears, select your account. A connection is created.

You can establish a connection to your custom CRM using the following methods:

### Add a custom CRM connector

Add a custom connector in one of the following ways:

#### Power Automate

1. Follow the steps in [Add a connection](/power-automate/add-manage-connections#add-a-connection) to find and add the custom CRM connector.
1. Specify the required information. A connection is created.

#### Add a custom CRM using API calls

1. Create a new [flow](/power-automate/get-started-logic-flow) in Power Automate.
1. Add the HTTP action and specify the required parameters such as the URL, method, and headers. In **Parameters** > **Authentication** set the **Authentication Type** to **Basic** and specify the **Username** and **Password**.

Your HTTP action can send and receive JSON requests and responses.

#### Add a custom CRM using webhooks

Set up webhooks in your custom CRM to facilitate incremental data synchronization. Webhooks trigger notifications upon the creation, update, or deletion of a record. 

To create webhooks, ensure you have the HTTP endpoint for the Power Automate flow. Perform the following steps to get the endpoint in Power Automate: 

1. Select the required flow and then select **Edit**. 
1. Select **Manual** in the flow, and then copy the HTTP URL. Repeat the steps for the organization and user flows for all the create, update, and delete operations.

You can use this URL as the webhook endpoint in your CRM.

### Add a custom CRM using Business rules

You can use trigger notifications when a record is created, updated, and deleted. You must use the Customer Service Plugin to trigger these notifications. You must create the script in the following order:

1. Create REST Message
2. Create Business Rule

### Use Apex triggers

Use [Apex triggers](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_dev_guide.htm). Ensure that your CRM instance has the required privileges to create the triggers.

## Run the Power Automate Flow 

In Power Automate, select the required flow and then select **Run**. 

> [!NOTE]
> The create, update, and delete events automatically trigger the flows.
