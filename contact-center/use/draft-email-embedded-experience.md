# Use Copilot to draft an email in non-microsoft CRMs

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embed-only](../includes/cc-feature-availability-embed-only.md)]


[!INCLUDE [cc-write-email-intro](../../shared/cc-write-email-intro.md)]

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [cc-write-email-prereq](../../shared/cc-write-email-prereq.md)]

## Navigation

When you sign in to a non-Microsoft CRM system, you can access the feature as follows:
   - Launch the embedded experience and then login to your Dynamics account.
   - In the Copilot help pane that appears, select **Write an email**.
   - Open an email to use the feature.
  
## Write an email


 You can use the predefined prompts to generate email drafts in the **Write an email** tab of the Copilot help pane:

[!INCLUDE [cc-write-email-prompts](../../shared/cc-write-email-prompts.md)]

 > [!NOTE]
 > - If the knowledge base isn't enabled, you see the **Suggest a call**, **Request more information**, **Empathize with feedback**, and **Custom** prompts only.
 > - If you've left the **Regarding** field empty, you see the **Suggest a call**, **Empathize with feedback**, and **Custom** prompts only.

## How Copilot uses knowledge base

If your administrator enabled knowledge sources, the following actions occur:
-  Copilot uses internal knowledge base sources and searches the internal knowledge base to generate email drafts. 
- The application displays the knowledge sources used to generate the draft when you select **Check sources**.
- When you use a custom prompt to refine the response, the application displays the **Use knowledge base** toggle that's set to **On**. You can switch the toggle to **Off** to disable knowledge base sources.
