# Use capacity planning to predict your staffing needs

Capacity planning enables you to forecast staffing needs at different levels of granularity, helping you align your workforce capacity with service demand.

Key ways you can plan for capacity are as follows:

**Short-term planning**: Forecast staffing needs in 15-minute intervals for up to six weeks, allowing real-time adjustments.
**Long-term planning**: Plan daily staffing requirements for up to six months to support strategic workforce decisions.
**Scenario analysis**: Model different workload scenarios to assess the impact of changes in demand.
**Data slicing**: View staffing projections by specific channels and queues for deeper insights.

## Prerequisites

To activate this feature, your administrator must first install the **Workforce Management for Customer Service** package in the Power Platform admin center app, and then enable the feature in Copilot Service admin center.
