# Configure feedback surveys using Copilot Studio (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

You can create and manage surveys that go out to the customers after a call or conversation ends. When you create a survey in Copilot Service admin center, the application automatically provisions an AI agent (agent) survey that can be used to collect customer feedback. Contact centers can improve their quality of service based on the survey responses.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

[!INCLUDE[cc-rebrand-bot-agent](../includes/cc-rebrand-bot-agent.md)]

The survey appears for the customer after the representative ends the conversation or call.

With survey agents, you can:
- Gather customer feedback and configure contextual actions depending on the feedback.
- Unify and centralize the process of configuring surveys across digital messaging, voice, and custom channels.
- Use predefined templates to create surveys.
- Allow supervisors to view and review feedback summarized into actionable insights.

> [!NOTE]
> - The survey agent is generally available for the voice channel and in preview for all other channels.
> - When you copy an environment, while the survey agents are copied, they won't work as expected in the target environment. We recommend that you create new survey agents in the target environment.

## How it works

1. Create a survey agent in Copilot Service admin center.
1. Edit the survey agent in Copilot Studio.
1. Add the survey agent to the appropriate channel.
1. Experience the survey runtime behavior in Copilot Service workspace.

## Prerequisites

- Copilot Studio and the channels in Dynamics 365 Contact Center or Dynamics 365 Customer Service are available in the same environment.
- Omnichannel administrator role.

## Create a survey

1. In the site map of Copilot Service admin center, go to **Customer settings** in **Customer Support**, and select **Manage** for **Customer feedback (preview)**.
1. On the **Customer feedback (preview)** page, select **New**.
1. On the **Add new customer feedback survey** wizard, select one of the following templates, and then select **Next**:
    - **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Survey**: Use to ask questions, such as, “On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate your overall satisfaction with the service you received?”
    - **Net Promoter Score (NPS) Survey**: Use to measure customer loyalty, such as, “On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our product/service/company?” 
    - **Customer Effort Score (CES)**: Use to quantify the ease with which customers can complete their desired actions or resolve issues when interacting with a company’s products or services. Frame questions, such as, “Were we able to resolve your issue?"
    - **Blank Template**: Use it to start a survey from scratch. 
1. On the **Properties** page, do the following:
    - **Name**: Enter a name based on the survey template that you selected.
    - **Select primary language**: Select a primary language from the supported languages list. The languages that are supported in Copilot Studio only appear.
    - Select the **Enable for Voice Channels** toggle if you want to use the survey for voice conversations.
1. Select **Next**, and on the page that appears, review your choices.
1. Select **Save survey**. The **Survey Created** page displays the summary and link to the survey where it's hosted. The application creates a survey agent with the same name as the survey and is hosted at the same link.
1. Select **Close**. The survey is listed on the **Customer feedback (preview)** page and its status displays as **In Progress**.

### Complete the configuration in Copilot Studio

After you create the survey in the admin center, it needs to be published. If you're creating the survey for the first time using Copilot Studio, the Dataverse connection must be set up before you publish the survey.

1. Select the survey that you created. The survey opens in Copilot Studio page on a new tab. 
1. Update the survey to suit your business needs. 
1. Select **Publish**. After a couple of minutes, the survey status is updated as **Ready** on the Copilot Service admin center **Customer feedback (preview)** page. For any publishing issues, see the [troubleshooting](/troubleshoot/dynamics-365/customer-service/omnichannel-for-customer-service/error-in-conversation-start-topic
) article.

### Verify the Dataverse connection

Make sure that the Dataverse connection is established for Copilot Studio so that you can publish the survey agent. 

1. Sign into Power Apps, and then go to **Solutions**.
1. On the **Solutions** page, select **Default Solution** under **Unmanaged**.
1. On the page that appears, search for **Connection references** under **Objects**, and then select **Microsoft Dataverse connection reference for MCS Survey**.
1. On the edit pane that appears, select a connection in the **Connection** box or select **New connection**. A new tab opens to create a connection.
1. Complete the steps to create a **Microsoft Dataverse** connection and select it in the **Connection** box.

Learn more in [Set up a Dataverse connection](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/create-connection-reference).

### Configure multilingual survey agents

In Dynamics 365 Contact Center, you can set the primary language only for the survey. You can configure multilingual surveys in Copilot Studio. Learn more in [Configure and create multilingual agents](/microsoft-copilot-studio/multilingual)

Multilingual survey agents work only when you set up an IVR agent that identifies the customer language.

### Considerations for multilingual survey agents

- Add all other supported languages as a secondary language with the locale codes that you expect the survey agent to handle.

- In the IVR agent, configure a topic with an **on redirect trigger** and set the following global variable: **va_CustomerLocale**.
- Set the **Global.va_CustomerLocale** variable in the topic for verifying the customer language.
- In your survey agent, make sure that the **Global.va_CustomerLocale** variable is set in the **Set Global Variables** topic.

  :::image type="content" source="../media/screenshot-survey-global-variable.png" alt-text="A screenshot of how the global variable needs to be configured in Copilot Studio topic." lightbox="../media/screenshot-survey-global-variable.png":::  

- If you don't see the **User.Language variable** in the **Conversation Start** topic, set it as follows and save and publish.
  
```
    Switch(
    Lower(Global.va_CustomerLocale), 
        "en-us", Locale.English, 
        "en-au", Locale.English_AU, 
        "en-gb", Locale.English_UK, 
        "es-es", Locale.Spanish, 
        "es-us", Locale.Spanish_US, 
        "tr-tr", Locale.Turkish, 
        "fr-fr", Locale.French, 
        "fr-ca", Locale.French_Canada, 
        "de-de", Locale.German, 
        "it-it", Locale.Italian, 
        "pt-pt", Locale.Portuguese_Brazilian, 
        "zh-cn", Locale.Chinese_Simplified, 
        "zh-tw", Locale.Chinese_Traditional, 
        "cs-cz", Locale.Czech, 
        "da-DK", Locale.Danish, 
        "fi-fi", Locale.Finnish, 
        "el-gr", Locale.Greek, 
        "hi-in", Locale.Hindi, 
        "id-id", Locale.Indonesian, 
        "nb-no", Locale.Norwegian, 
        "pl-pl", Locale.Polish, 
        "ru-ru", Locale.Russian, 
        "sv-se", Locale.Swedish, 
        "th-th", Locale.Thai, 
        "ja-jp", Locale.Japanese, 
        "ko-kr", Locale.Korean, 
        System.User.Language // Default
    )
```  

### Manage the surveys

The surveys that you create using the **Customer feedback (preview)** option only appear on the **Customer feedback (preview)** page. You can't manage surveys created using other methods, such as Customer Voice.

Manage your surveys on the **Customer feedback (preview)** page.
- **Edit**: Select a survey, and then select **Edit**. You can edit the survey name only.
- **Demo link**: Select a link to preview the survey and see how it appears in runtime.
- **Status**: Indicates whether a survey is ready or in progress.
- **Voice Enabled**: Indicates whether a survey is enabled for the voice channel.

### Manage the survey agents in Copilot Studio

You can edit your survey agents to fulfill your business needs as follows:
- Customize agent messages
- Add branching logic
- Add more actions
- Add extra topic questions

Edit the **Conversation Start** system topic only. All other system topics are disabled and must not be used.  
To add another question and store the data in Dataverse, the response variable name must start with “MCS_”.  
To add another context to pass to the survey agent, make sure that the context variable name is set to "mcs_additionalcontext" and set the value as JSON key value pair.  

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you don't delete the survey agent from Copilot Studio.

### Set up custom hosting

You can host surveys on a link other than the default one.

1. In Copilot Service admin center, select the survey that you want to custom host.
1. Select the survey and select **Edit**.
1. In **Survey URL**, enter the custom host page URL where you want to display the survey.
1. Do the following for a seamless hosting experience:
    1. Extract the query parameters from the custom host URL and enter in the code snippet.
    1. In the cshtml file, use following code.

    ```
        @{ 
            var environment = Request.Query["Environment"]; 
        
            var bot = Request.Query["Bot"]; 
        
            var surveyVersion = Request.Query["SurveyVersion"]; 
        
            var regardingLiveWorkItemId = Request.Query["RegardingLiveWorkItemId"]; 
        
            var surveyId = Request.Query["SurveyId"]; 
        
            var invitationId = Request.Query["InvitationId"]; 
        } 
    ```

1. Copy the following code snippet and paste it to your HTML website.
   
    ``` 
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <body> 
        <iframe src="https://powerva.microsoft.com/environments/@environment/bots/@bot/webchat?__version__=2&SurveyVersion=@surveyVersion&RegardingLiveWorkItemId=@regardingLiveWorkItemId&SurveyId=@surveyId&InvitationId=@invitationId" frameborder="0" style="width: 300px; height: 500px;"></iframe> 
        </body> 
        </html>  
    ```
1. Style the iframe to match your website.

## Enable the post-conversation survey for digital messaging channels

1. Perform the steps 1 through 3 in [Configure the post-conversation survey](/dynamics365/customer-service/administer/configure-post-conversation-survey#configure-the-post-conversation-survey).
1. Select **Powered by Microsoft Copilot Studio (preview)**. Select a survey from the list. Only those surveys that you create using the customer feedback option and in published state are displayed for you to select.
1. Perform the rest of the steps in **Configure the post-conversation survey**.

## Enable the post-call survey for the voice channel

1. In Copilot Service admin center, go to the voice workstream and select **Edit**. 
1. On the **Behaviors** tab, scroll to the bottom of the page and enable the toggle for Post-call survey.
1. In **Customer feedback survey**, select a survey from the list. Only those surveys that you create using the customer feedback option and in published state are displayed for you to select.
1. Save the changes.

You can obtain customer consent for post-call surveys as follows:

- **Automatic - implicit**: The IVR agent informs the customer about a post-call survey at the end of the call. After the agent disconnects, the call is automatically transferred to a post-call survey agent.
- **Automatic - explicit**: The IVR agent asks the customer if they want to participate in a post-call survey. The consent is saved in a va_SurveyConsent Boolean variable. If the customer consents, the call is automatically transferred to the post-call survey agent at the end of the call. If the customer says no, the call ends when the agent hangs up.
- **Agent-initiated**: Towards the end of a call, the agent can ask the customer if they want to take a survey. If the customer says yes, the agent manually transfers the call to the survey agent.

## View the survey results

The survey results are stored in Dataverse tables. To view the survey responses, in Power Apps, go to **Tables**, and select **Customer feedback survey response**.

The CSAT scores are displayed in the Omnichannel historical analytics report.

## Configure case resolution survey

You can configure the system to send a survey through email after the service representative resolves a case.

Follow these steps to configure post-case resolution surveys in Copilot Service admin center:

1. In the site map, under **Customer Support** > **Case settings**, select **Manage** for **Post case resolution survey (preview)**. The post case resolution surveys are triggered through Power Automate flows. The **Enable survey invite flow** dialog appears.
1. Select **Turn on**. The Power Automate flows page opens on a new tab.
   - Search for and enable the **Send a Microsoft Copilot Survey bot when a case is resolved in Dynamics 365** flow.
   - Alternatively, you can enable the cloud flow in Power Apps > **Solutions** > **Default Solution** under **Unmanaged**, and search for **Send a Microsoft Copilot Survey bot when a case is resolved in Dynamics 365**.
1. Go back to the admin center, and in **Post case resolution survey (preview)**, do the following actions:
   1. Turn on the **Enable case resolution survey** toggle. The **Microsoft Copilot Studio survey** and **Email template** areas appear.
   1. Select **Microsoft Copilot Studio survey**, and on the **Survey** pane that appears, select a survey in **Default survey**, and then save and close.
   1. The email template to send the survey link to customers is selected by default. You can create and set an email template of your choice. Learn more in [Create email templates](/power-apps/user/email-template-create?context=%2Fdynamics365%2Fcontext%2Fcustomer-service-context).
1. Save the corresponding changes.
