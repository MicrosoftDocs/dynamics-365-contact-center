# Configure shift activity types

A shift activity type helps you define the type of work to be performed as part of a booking. Shift activity types help you manage and schedule customer service representative (service representative or representative) activities, and coordinate and schedule resources.

## Prerequisites

1. Install the **Workforce Management for Customer Service** package in the Power Platform admin center app.
1. Set up your user profiles:
     1. In the site map of the Copilot Service admin center app, go to **Operations**, and then select **Workforce management**. The **Workforce management** page appears.
     1. In **Workforce setup**, select **View** next to **User management**.

   Refer to the following articles to set up your user profiles.
    -	[Manage user profiles](users-user-profiles.md)
    -	[Create and manage capacity profiles](capacity-profiles.md)
    -	[Manage personas and custom security profiles](role-persona-mapping.md)
