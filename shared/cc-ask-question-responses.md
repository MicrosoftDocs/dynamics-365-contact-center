Copilot streams the generated responses on the UI incrementally, and you can view the responses as they're generated. You can also select **Stop responding** for Copilot to stop generating responses, allowing you to start afresh.

In the Copilot's response, you can see citation numbers that show the knowledge base or website links from which Copilot drew the response. When you select the citation, you can see an inline link to the source.

If you're satisfied with the response Copilot provides, you can use the whole thing or a part of it to answer the customer's question:

- Copy part of Copilot's reply into your chat or read from it during a voice conversation. Select the copy icon to copy the entire response to the clipboard.  
- When you're in an active digital messaging conversation, select **Send to customer** to open an editing window where you can revise the response and send it to the customer. You can also change customer keywords to prompt Copilot to generate a more accurate response.
- Select **Check sources** to see the knowledge base or website links from which Copilot drew the response. You can use this supplemental information as a resource or share it with the customer.
