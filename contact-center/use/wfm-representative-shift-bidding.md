# Use shift bidding to select shifts

Shift bidding allows customer service representatives (service representatives, representatives) to participate in selecting their shifts through a bidding process. Supervisors release shift plans for bidding, detailing available shifts, and then representatives can submit bids based on their preferred working hours. Shifts are assigned based on the best match, and then representatives are notified and can confirm their assigned shifts.

## Use shift bidding

1. On the Copilot Service workspace site map, select **Request Management** under **Workforce Management**. The **All Active Requests** page appears, and shows a list of all requests.
1. Select **New**, and then select **Shift Bid**. The **New WEM Request** page opens.
1. On the **Shift Plan To Bid** card, select the shift plan you want to bid on.
1. Review the bid request details, and then select **Save**.
