# Set up the embedded experience in Salesforce

The embedded conversation widget is a feature of Dynamics 365 Contact Center that allows customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) to chat or have voice conversations with customers directly from any non-Microsoft customer relationship management (CRM) system. You can embed the widget into a web page or application that supports HTML and JavaScript. Representatives have seamless and consistent conversation experience across different platforms.

## Prerequisites

- The prerequisites mentioned in the system requirements are set up. Learn more in [Prerequisites](../implement/system-requirements-contact-center.md#prerequisites).
  
- Omnichannel capabilities are enabled in your org. Learn more in [Provision channels](../implement/provision-channels.md).

- The provisioning user has System Administrator permissions in Salesforce.

- You have the widget URL. To find the embedded widget URL, go to the welcome page of the Copilot Service admin center. Select **Open** under **Your default contact center** and then navigate to the **Conversation widget** tab. The URL is listed under **Integration into third-party systems**.
