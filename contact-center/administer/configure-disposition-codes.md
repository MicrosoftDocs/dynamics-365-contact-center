# Configure disposition codes

[!INCLUDE[cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes](../../includes/cc-feature-availability-embedded-yes.md)]

Disposition codes help you categorize and record the outcome of each customer interaction with the customer service representative(service representatives or representatives) in a contact center, enabling you to assess and improve customer interactions.

Perform the following steps to enable disposition codes for voice and chat channels:

1. In the Customer Service admin center or Contact Center admin center, select **Customer settings** in **Customer support**.
1. In the **Customer settings** page, select **Manage** for **Disposition code**.
1. On the **Disposition Code** page, select the **Turn on Disposition Code** checkbox.
1. In the **New Disposition Code** textbox, specify a name for the disposition code, and then select **Add**.
   The disposition code is added to the list of disposition codes. You can add more disposition codes by repeating the previous step.
1. Select a disposition code from the list, and then select **Delete** to remove the disposition code.
> [!NOTE]
> Id you delete a disposition code that is associated with a conversation, the conversation will still have the disposition code. 
1. Select **Save**.

## Runtime experience

When you enable disposition codes, service representatives can't close a session without selecting a disposition code. The disposition code is recorded in the conversation transcript and can be used for reporting and analysis. Learn more in [Disposition codes]()
