# Use the Desktop companion application with the voice channel (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]


The Desktop companion application serves as a backup when the Dynamics 365 Customer Service or Dynamics 365 Contact Center web application encounters issues and allows you to continue conversations without interruption.

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

## Prerequisites

The Desktop companion application is installed on your desktop or the browser extension is installed.

## Use the Desktop companion application

After you sign in to the Copilot Service workspace and receive a call, you can view the call in the Desktop companion application. Perform one of the following actions to launch the application:

- Open the application from the Windows toolbar to manage the call in the application and continue the conversation from the web browser. You can also minimize the application which will continue to run in the background.
 
 > [!NOTE]
 > If you can't see the icon, restart your device. If the desktop companion application doesn't appear after restarting, contact your administrator.
 
- Launch the application from the browser extension. 

Launch the application if you face issues such as network latency, web application freezes or reloads. You can also make sure that your headset and wireless devices stay connected using the application.

You can do the following actions:

- View the environment you're signed in to and your sign-in information.
- View ongoing calls.
- On an active call, you can use the call controls to mute, unmute the call, or end the call.
- You can switch between an active call and a call that's on hold.
- Select **Settings** to do the following actions:
   - Select **Language** to specify the language you want to use.
   - In the **Device Settings** section, you can view the available microphone and speaker devices and select the device you want to use. To save your headset and microphone preferences, first select devices that aren't your default devices and then switch to your preferred devices. This saves your preferences.
   - Select **Test Call** to ensure that the microphone and speaker are working well.
   - View the application's version information in **About this app**.
