# Use the Desktop companion application with the voice channel (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

The Desktop companion application is a backup system when the Dynamics 365 Customer Service or Dynamics 365 Contact Center web application faces issues, that allows customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) to continue customer conversations without interruption.

## Prerequisites

- The Desktop companion application is installed on your desktop.


## Use the Desktop companion application

After you sign in to Contact Center or Customer Service and you receive a call, you can launch the Desktop companion application from the windows toolbar to continue the conversation from the web browser.

You can launch the application if the web application freezes or reloads, during network latency issues, or to ensure that your headset and wireless devices aren't disconnected.
