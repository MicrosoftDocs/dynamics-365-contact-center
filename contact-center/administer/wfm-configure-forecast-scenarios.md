# Enable volume forecasting for supervisors

Forecasting allows supervisors to predict case and conversation volumes, and customer service representative demand based on historical trends.

Key benefits include:

- **Long term Forecast:** Predict conversation and case volumes at a daily level for up to six months.
- **Short term Forecast:** Generate 15-minute interval forecasts for up to six weeks to manage real-time demand fluctuations.
- **Scenario Forecasting:** Model different business scenarios to assess their impact on workload and staffing.
- **Data Slicing:** Break down forecasted data by channels and queues for granular insights.
- **Import External Data:** Incorporate historical data from external systems via file import to enhance forecast accuracy.
- **Export Forecasts:** Download forecast data into spreadsheets for further analysis.
- **Visualize Trends:** View daily, weekly, and monthly forecast trends using interactive charts.
