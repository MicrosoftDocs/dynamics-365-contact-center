# Use shift swapping

Shift swapping lets you customer service representatives (service representatives, representatives) exchange their bookings and provide coverage for themselves and other representatives without affecting the schedule. 

Key features include the following:

- Supervisors receive notifications via email or in-app when a swap request is accepted or rejected by agents.
- Supervisors can review and either approve or decline swap requests as part of the approval process.
- Service representatives can swap shifts 1:1 with a colleague, or post the swap request publicly for any team member to pick up.
- Representatives can receive notifications via email or in-app when the swap is accepted or rejected by a colleague. 

## Create a shift swap request

Complete the following steps:

1. In the Copilot Service workspace app, go to **Service Calendar**.
1. Select **New** > **Shift swap request**. The **New WEM Request** page appears.
1. On the **Details** tab, complete the following items: 
      1. **Date**: Date when you want to swap the shift.
      1. **Shift Plan**: Select the shift from the dropdown list.
      1. **Full shift day**: If you want to swap the entire day, turn on the toggle.
      1. **Booking**: If you aren't swapping the entire day, select the booking you want to swap. Once you select a booking, the **Start Time**, **End Time**, and **Hours** populate automatically.
      1. **Note**: Enter a note if desired.
      1. Select **Save**.
