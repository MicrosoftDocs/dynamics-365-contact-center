- **Customer Knowledge Management Agent:** Helps extract knowledge from cases and manage customer knowledge in real time. After a case is closed, the Customer Knowledge Management Agent analyzes case details, fills knowledge gaps, and makes sure of compliance.

- **Quality Evaluation Agent:** Helps generate autonomous and AI-assisted assessments of customer interactions across cases and conversations using an evaluation framework defined by supervisors.

- **Customer Intent Agent:** Uses generative AI to identify the most common intents and suggests new ones, helping you understand customer needs better. Learn more in [Use Customer Intent Agent-based suggestions to handle conversations](/dynamics365/contact-center/use/use-intent-suggestions).
- **Customer Intent Agent for voice:** Uses generative AI to autonomously discover intents in your Dynamics 365 Contact Center instance. Intent benefits self-service scenarios by enabling agents to quickly understand customer needs, guide conversations with follow-up questions, and provide tailored solutions in real time.[Set up voice agents to use intents](/dynamics365/contact-center/administer/set-up-voice-agents-to-use-intents)
- **Intent-based routing:** Enhances the efficiency and accuracy of routing customer interactions. By capturing customer intents from incoming conversations and mapping them to appropriate solutions, intent-based routing makes sure that customer queries are directed to the most suitable service representatives.

- **Rollout manager:** Helps AI administrators and supervisors adopt autonomous AI agents in a phased, guided, and controlled manner. Learn more in [Use rollout plans to manage AI agents](/dynamics365/contact-center/administer/create-rollout-plans).
- **Agent insights dashboard:** Equips supervisors with real-time visibility into key performance indicators and operational trends regarding their AI agents. Learn more in [View the Agent insights dashboard to monitor AI agent performance](/dynamics365/contact-center/use/agent-insights).
