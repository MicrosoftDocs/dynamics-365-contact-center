# Overview of AI agents and Copilot features

Dynamics 365 Customer Service and Dynamics 365 Contact Center use AI agents and Copilot features to enhance customer service operations. They help automate routine tasks, provide intelligent responses, and assist customer service representatives (service representatives or representatives) in delivering optimal service. Autonomous agents are AI-driven programs that can converse with customers, deflect routine issues, collect context, and—when needed—handoff to a human **customer service representative** with full conversation history.

Autonomous service agents are AI-powered virtual agents that can handle customer interactions independently, providing quick and efficient responses to common inquiries and issues.
