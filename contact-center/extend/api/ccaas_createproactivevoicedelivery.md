# Use CCaaS_CreateProactiveVoiceDelivery API

You can use the `CCaaS_CreateProactiveVoiceDelivery` API to initiate proactive outbound voice calls to customers or allow customers to schedule callbacks through the Proactive Engagement Service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If an organization is using the `CCaaS_CreateProactiveVoiceDelivery` API to initiate an outbound voice call, the organization is responsible for consent management, including the manual updating of "do not call lists" for setting quiet hours for customer contact. Make sure that the following conditions are met:
> - Proper consent is obtained before contacting customers
> - Customers are contacted during permitted hours only.

## Prerequisites

- You must have the Omnichannel Agent or Omnichannel Supervisor role to call this API.
- Proactive engagement is configured. Learn more in [Configure proactive engagement (preview)](../../administer/configure-proactive-engagement.md).

## Initiate proactive outbound calls

Proactive engagement enables organizations to enhance customer interactions by initiating outbound communications through the voice channel. You can configure proactive engagement using a Customer Insights journey or the `CCaaS_CreateProactiveVoiceDelivery`.

 The `CCaaS_CreateProactiveVoiceDelivery` API enables organizations to initiate proactive outbound voice calls to customers through the Proactive Engagement Service. The API triggers outbound voice calls through the Voice Runtime system. Calls are placed according to the configured dial mode either immediately (if no time windows are specified) or during the designated time windows you provide.

This API allows contact centers to reach out to customers at the right time with relevant information, reminders, or notifications, enhancing customer experience while optimizing operational efficiency.

```

{
	"@odata.context": "[Organization URI]api/data/v9.2/$metadata#Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.CCaaS_CreateProactiveVoiceDeliveryResponse",

}

``` 

## Schedule callbacks from any platform

You can use the Proactive Engagement solution to schedule callbacks from various platforms including web, mobile applications, voice and chat agents. You can do this in the following ways:

- Create a Power Automate flow from the Copilot Studio agent.
- Integrate the schedule callback API with your website.


### Create a Power Automate flow from the Copilot agent

You can create a Power Automate flow from the Copilot agent to schedule callbacks. Perform the following steps:

1. Do the steps in [Create a flow you can use with an agent](/microsoft-copilot-studio/advanced-flow-create#create-a-flow-you-can-use-with-an-agent) with the following parameters:
  - Specify **Perform an unbound action** as the action.
  - Select **CCaaS_CreateProactiveVoiceDelivery** as the **Action Name**.
  - In **Advanced parameters**, specify the following mandatory fields:
      - **Item/DestinationPhoneNumber**: Phone number of the customer to call.
      - **Item/ProactiveEngagementConfigId**: Id of the proactive engagement configuration to use. This indicates the dial mode type, workstream, and outbound profile to use when contacting the customer. You can copy this ID from Power Apps > **Tables** > **Proactive Engagement Configuration** table.
      - **Item/ApiVersion**: 1.0
      - **Item/ContactId**: Id of the customer contact in Dynamics CRM.
      - Optionally, you can specify **Item/InputAttributes**. This field should contain a JSON object which is used by the Copilot agent. For example, `{ "msdyn_CaseTitle" : "Vitre cass√©e", "msdyn_CustomerName" : "Sarah", "msdyn_CustomerPhone" : "+1234567890", "msdyn_CustomerId" : "cfaa617b-2fc1-ef11-b8e8-000d3a5bcd16" }`.
