When you sign in to any of the customer service representative (service representative or representative) apps, Copilot opens in the right side panel with the **Ask a question** tab ready. Copilot acts as your partner, helping to answer questions without you having to search for the information. Copilot quickly retrieves information, generates summaries for cases, and gets required details about case data, all within the same interface.
