# Overview of Contact Center workspace

The Contact Center workspace application on a web browser provides a unified and consistent single-view experience for the agents to view conversation details, customer information, and access Line-of-Business applications from within the app. As an agent, you can use the app to manage the assigned work items and have simultaneous customer sessions without losing the context of each session. You can view the holistic data of the customer with the details of their previous interaction, which ensures you have all the available information to resolve the customer issue.
