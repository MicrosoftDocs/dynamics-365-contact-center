# Configure intent-based suggestions for Copilot Studio bot

As an administrator, you'll no longer need to manually create and manage Copilot Studio topics that could be deprecated.

Intent assist discovers historical data and maintains an up-to-date intent library, along with the attributes to support intent determination, interview, and fulfillment, leading to much higher deflection.

Intent assist uses the determined intent and interview responses to also improve the quality of generated answers for both Copilot Studio bots and customer service representatives.

## Prerequisites

- **Customer Intent Agent (preview)** is enabled.
- Intent discovery is set up and there are intents in the intent library.
- Your Copilot Studio bot must be connected to a workstream in omnichannel.

## Here's how it works

- An administrator sets up intent, harvests historical data to build intent library, and enables the library for Copilot Studio bots and customer service representatives. The administrator also enables knowledge harvesting and connects to the Copilot Studio bots.
- Copilot Studio bot detects intent from the customer, asks follow-up questions related to the intent, and provides a solution based on customer provided information from the connected Copilot Studio bot knowledge source.
- If the issue is escalated, it's transferred to customer service representatives and the customer service representatives persists intent and interview questions generated by Copilot Studio bots, goes through unanswered questions with customer, and gets an updated solution.
- Once the issue is closed, a new knowledge article for the undocumented resolved issue is harvested, along with new intent attributes for use in self service.
- The supervisor approves and publishes the article, and it's made available in the knowledge source that the Copilot Studio bot is connected to.
- The application also harvests this conversation to detect any updates, and discovers new intent attributes that can be used in future interviews.
- In the next customer interaction with a Copilot Studio bot, the Copilot Studio bot can self service the customer issue with the newly harvested knowledge and intent, and provide a tailored response without the involvement of any customer service representative.
