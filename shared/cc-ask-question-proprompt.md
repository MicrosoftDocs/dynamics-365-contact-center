Copilot proactively suggests prompts, without you having to type one, that you can use to prioritize cases effectively and solve customer queries quickly.

- You can use the default prompts, such as **Summarize**, **Ask**, and **Discover** to get started with Copilot, with just a single click. For example, you can select the **Summarize** prompt to get a case summary. After you select **Summarize**, enter the case number to view the case details on the help pane, without having to open the case.
- You can also save frequently used prompts for quick access.
- You can select **View prompts** to use one of the following prompts:
   - Default prompts 
   - Prompts set up by your administrator
   - Prompts that you bookmarked
- You can use Copilot to get summaries of multiple cases in the help pane, that help you decide which case to work on first, based on priority and customer needs.
- When you pick your case or a new conversation to work on, the context of Copilot switches to the particular case and suggests new prompts automatically, without you having to type one. Copilot gathers relevant information and provides you with the information, thereby increasing your efficiency in resolving customer issues.
