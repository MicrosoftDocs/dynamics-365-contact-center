# Enable Copilot to draft emails 

Agents can draft emails faster with Copilot. Agents can draft emails in the Copilot side pane or inline from the rich text editor. 

## Enable knowledge sources for Copilot to draft emails

By default, the option to use knowledge sources to draft emails is disabled. If you want Copilot to use knowledge articles or trusted websites to draft emails, you must [enable knowledge sources for Copilot](copilot-enable-help-pane.md#enable-knowledge-base).


## Enable write an email in the side pane

To enable your agents to use the write an email feature from the Copilot side pane, perform the following steps in Customer Service admin center:

1. Go to **Copilot help pane** using one of following options:
      - **Agent Experience** > **Productivity** 
      - **Operations** > **Insights**
1. Select **Manage** in **Copilot help pane**. The **Copilot help pane** page appears. 
1. Switch the **Write an email - Help pane** toggle to **On**.
1. Select **Save**.

### Modify the fields used to draft emails

You can modify the source case fields that Copilot uses to draft emails and improve the context and accuracy of the results. You can also select a custom field that Copilot uses to generate responses.

Copilot uses the following out-of-the-box case fields to draft emails:

- Case Title
- Case Description
- Customer Contact
- Subject
- Case Notes
- Email Content
